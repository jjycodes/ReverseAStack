# ReverseAStack

Reverse the contents of a stack using only one other stack and no other data structures. 

Rules

•	The same stack containing the initial contents should contain the reversed contents.
•	You can use any other variables (not Arrays, that’s a data structure.)  
•	It has to be applicable to any length of data.
•	You can only push/pop your Stack i.e. you cannot enumerate its contents.
•	Anybody who uses Stack.Reverse will of course, be ridiculed. 
•	A list of items will be pushed onto the stack. (the only time you can use a list)
